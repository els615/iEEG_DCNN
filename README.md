# iEEG_DCNN

### Code to train neural networks, extract feature representations from hidden layers, and perform semi-partial tau analysis. 

## Models
- Identity
- Expression
- Object
- Untrained

## Tau analysis
- calculate semi-partial tau_b between neural RDM and model layer RDM while controlling for previous model layers
- BIC for model selection
